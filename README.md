# School District Analysis
## Overview
  The Purpose of this analysis was to track the performance of a number of different schools in a district on a math and reading test. We conducted analysis that spanned across everything from grade level to comparing district schools with charter schools, and seeing if the per student funding affected test scores. We also removed ninth grade students from Thomas High School from the analysis due to suspected cheating.

## Analysis
. There was strong evidence to suggest that charter schools performed better on both exams than district schools
. The five schools with the lowest overall pass rate were all district schools
. Removing ninth grade students from Thomas High School from the analysis had very little affect on overall numbers
. There was not a signifacnt difference for any school based on the grade level of the students
. There was negative correlation between school funding per student and performance
. Large schools performed significantly worse than small and medium sized schools

## Conclusion
  Some key conclusions we can draw are that this district's charter schools are performing much better than the district schools. From the data, there is not evidence of a cheating scandal at Thomas High School. The largest schools in the district performed the worst on the tests despite getting the most funding. There needs to be something done besides increased funding in order to improve school performance.
